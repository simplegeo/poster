Description: Streaming HTTP uploads and multipart/form-data encoding
 The modules in the Python standard library don't provide a way to
 upload large files via HTTP without having to load the entire file
 into memory first.
 .
 poster provides support for both streaming POST requests as well as
 multipart/form-data encoding of string or file parameters
